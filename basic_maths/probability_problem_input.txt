You’re considering a $100 bet with your friend. If `n` consecutive
  fair coin flips result in all heads, then you win - else your friend wins. Your friend agrees to let you attempt
  the bet as many times as you’d like. Assuming you attempt the bet `x`
  times, what's the probability that you’ll win the bet at least once? As well, what should your winning payout ($100, $200, etc)
  be to ensure that you at least break even given unlimited attempts of the bet?

  Write a function which takes in the number of consecutive coin flips (n) and the
  number of bet attempts (x) and returns a list containing:

1. Firstly, the probability that you win the bet at least once</li>
2. Secondly, your required winning payout</li>

Note that:
1. You can assume a fair coin.</li>
2. You shouldn't use any libraries.</li>
3.  Your output values will automatically be rounded to the fourth decimal.

Sample Input
n= 3
x = 10

Sample Output
[73.6…, 135.6…]
